## Code Quality Assessment

### Quality Score: B (81/100)

#### Positive Patterns:
- **Modern Go Practices:** Uses modules, proper error handling patterns, context propagation
- **Code Organization:** Logical package structure with clear boundaries
- **Naming Conventions:** Consistent and descriptive naming throughout
- **Interface Design:** Small, focused interfaces following Go conventions

#### Areas for Improvement:

**Formatting Issues (Medium Priority)**
- ⚠️ **Issue:** All source files require `gofmt` formatting
- **Impact:** Code consistency and readability
- **Files Affected:** All 19 Go source files
- **Recommendation:** Run `gofmt -w .` to fix formatting

**Documentation Gaps (Low Priority)**
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Missing package-level documentation and exported function comments
- **Impact:** Developer experience and maintainability
- **Recommendation:** Add godoc comments for exported functions and packages

**Error Handling Patterns (Medium Priority)**
- ✅ **Strength:** Proper error propagation and handling
- ⚠️ **Issue:** Some error cases ignored with `_` (especially in `model.go:45-50`)
- **Recommendation:** Add error logging for ignored errors in non-critical paths

## Security Assessment

### Security Score: B+ (85/100)

#### Secure Practices:
- ✅ **API Key Handling:** Proper environment variable usage for sensitive data
- ✅ **HTTP Security:** Uses HTTPS by default, proper proxy support
- ✅ **Input Validation:** No direct user input execution
- ✅ **Dependency Security:** Uses reputable, well-maintained dependencies

#### Security Considerations:

**Environment Variables (Good)**
```go
APIKey: os.Getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")  // ✅ Proper secret handling
```

**HTTP Client Security (Good)**
- Timeout configuration prevents hanging requests
- Proxy support with environment variable fallback
- Proper error handling for HTTP failures

**Recommendations:**
- Consider adding request rate limiting for OpenAI API calls
- Add input sanitization for user prompts before API calls
- Consider implementing API key validation on startup

## Performance Analysis

### Performance Score: B (80/100)

#### Efficient Patterns:
- ✅ **HTTP Client:** Reuses connections with proper timeout configuration
- ✅ **Streaming:** Implements token-by-token streaming for real-time feedback
- ✅ **Memory Management:** Uses string builders for efficient concatenation
- ✅ **Goroutine Safety:** Proper context usage and cancellation

#### Performance Considerations:

**Streaming Implementation (Good)**
```go
// Efficient streaming with proper buffer management
scanner.Buffer(make([]byte, 0, 4096), 1024*1024)
```

**UI Performance (Good)**
- Dynamic layout calculation based on content
- Viewport-based rendering prevents memory bloat
- Smart mouse handling with auto-detection

**Potential Optimizations:**
- Consider connection pooling for HTTP clients
- Add debouncing for rapid UI updates
- Memory profiling recommended for long-running sessions

## Architecture Review

### Architecture Score: A- (88/100)

#### Strong Design Patterns:

**Event-Driven Architecture**
- Clean pub/sub messaging system
- Decoupled component communication
- Proper context propagation

**Dependency Injection**
```go
func NewRootModel(ctx context.Context, cfg platform.Config) RootModel {
    // Clean dependency injection pattern
    llmClient := llmClientFrom(cfg)
    researcher := agent.NewResearcher(bus, llmClient, service)
}
```

**Interface Segregation**
- Small, focused interfaces (Client, EventBus, UnitOfWork)
- Proper abstraction boundaries
- Testable design

#### Areas for Enhancement:

**Database Layer (Stub Implementation)**
- Current storage layer is a no-op implementation
- Consider implementing actual persistence for production use
- SQLite integration would align with stated architecture goals

**Error Recovery**
- Add circuit breaker patterns for external API calls
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add graceful degradation for offline scenarios

## Testing Analysis

### Testing Score: D (40/100)

#### Current State:
- ❌ **No Test Files Found:** No `*_test.go` files in codebase
- ❌ **No Test Infrastructure:** No testing framework setup
- ❌ **No CI/CD Integration:** No automated testing pipeline

#### Testing Recommendations:

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Add unit tests for core business logic (`internal/app/`, `internal/agent/`)
2. Add integration tests for LLM client (`internal/llm/openai_test.go`)
3. Add TUI component tests using Bubble Tea testing utilities

**Test Structure Suggestion:**
```
├── internal/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── sessions.go
│   │   └── sessions_test.go
│   ├── llm/
│   │   ├── openai.go
│   │   └── openai_test.go
│   └── agent/
│       ├── research.go
│       └── research_test.go
```

**Testing Strategy:**
- Mock external dependencies (OpenAI API)
- Use table-driven tests for configuration parsing
- Add integration tests with test environments

## Dependencies Analysis

### Dependency Health: A (90/100)

#### Core Dependencies:
```go
// UI Framework - Excellent choice
github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea v0.24.2
github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles v0.16.1
github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss v0.9.1

// Standard library focus - Good for reliability
```

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Minimal external dependencies (3 core deps)
- ✅ Well-maintained, popular libraries
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities detected
- ✅ Compatible with Go 1.22

**Recommendations:**
- Consider updating to latest Bubble Tea versions
- Monitor for security updates regularly

## Build and Deployment

### Build Quality: A- (87/100)

#### Build Process:
```bash
go build ./cmd/gotcha  # ✅ Clean build process
go mod tidy           # ✅ Proper dependency management
go vet ./...          # ✅ Static analysis passes
```

**Binary Analysis:**
- Size: 9.8MB (reasonable for Go TUI app)
